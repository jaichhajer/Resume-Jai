            <h2 class="section-header">Summary</h2>
            <p class="section-content"> Hi there! Jai here, thank you for taking interest in me. I am currently pursuing the Technology & Business
                Management (TBM) course at Masters' Union.
                I am a curious and ambitious person with entrepreneurship in my gene and blood. Understanding businesses,
                their 'Behind-the-Scenes' and going deep into their 'why' and 'how' are my keen interests. I enjoy taking on
                leadership roles and getting the desired results. I also constantly seek to explore - be it learning or grabbing new
                opportunities and work towards self-improvement every single day.
                Aside from my entrepreneurial aspirations, I am also committed to give back to our world, with a mission to
                positively impact 1 million lives by 2050. Our NGO 'Raah' is a manifestation of that mission and volunteering in
                other organisations such as 'MBDD' , 'TKM' & 'Interact Club' are accelerator pedals towards the landmark.
                Sports is a big part of my life, and I love discussing and analyzing everything from football to Formula 1 (and
                also play some of them in my free time). On the other hand, Meditation is a key part of me and my daily dose of
                'BOOST' and apart from these, entertaining people around me with my 'quirky' sense of humour would be the
                favourite hobby.
                Currently I am learning and traversing personal finance, videography & editing, web3, content writing,
                neuroscience and a must - cooking.</p>
